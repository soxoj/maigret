Welcome to the Maigret docs!
============================

**Maigret** is an easy-to-use and powerful OSINT tool for collecting a dossier on a person by username only.

This is achieved by checking for accounts on a huge number of sites and gathering all the available information from web pages.

The project's main goal - give to OSINT researchers and pentesters a **universal tool** to get maximum information about a subject and integrate it with other tools in automatization pipelines.
