Welcome to the Maigret docs!
============================

**Maigret** is an easy-to-use and powerful OSINT tool for collecting a dossier on a person by a username (alias) only.

This is achieved by checking for accounts on a huge number of sites and gathering all the available information from web pages.

The project's main goal â€” give to OSINT researchers and pentesters a **universal tool** to get maximum information
about a person of interest by a username and integrate it with other tools in automatization pipelines.
