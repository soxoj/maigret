# Maigret Modernization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for fixing and modernizing Maigret, making it faster, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Integrate Optimized Components

The optimized components in `optimized_*.py` files show significant performance improvements. We should integrate these improvements into the main codebase.

- Replace current HTTP connection handling with `optimized_checker.py`
- Update the executor implementation with `optimized_executor.py`
- Integrate the optimized site database from `optimized_sites.py`
- Replace the main implementation with improvements from `optimized_maigret.py`

### 2. Code Quality and Structure

- Refactor the codebase to use more type hints throughout
- Implement proper error handling with specific exception types
- Improve logging to be more consistent and useful for debugging
- Add proper docstrings to all functions and classes

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Implement connection pooling as shown in `optimized_checker.py`
- Optimize memory usage with `__slots__` for frequently instantiated classes
- Implement lazy loading for site data to reduce startup time
- Add domain-based batching for more efficient HTTP requests

### 4. Modern Python Practices

- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.10+ 
- Use more modern Python features (structural pattern matching, walrus operator, etc.)
- Update dependency versions to their latest secure versions
- Implement proper async context managers

### 5. Testing and CI/CD

- Expand test coverage for core functionality
- Add benchmarking to CI pipeline to track performance
- Create more comprehensive integration tests
- Add type checking to CI pipeline

## Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: Core Optimization**
   - Integrate optimized HTTP client
   - Update executor implementation
   - Implement connection pooling and reuse

2. **Phase 2: Data Handling**
   - Implement lazy loading for site data
   - Optimize memory usage for site objects
   - Create indexing for faster site lookups

3. **Phase 3: Code Quality**
   - Add comprehensive type hints
   - Standardize error handling
   - Improve documentation

4. **Phase 4: Testing**
   - Expand test coverage
   - Implement benchmarking
   - Ensure backward compatibility

## Metrics for Success

- **Performance**: At least 2x faster execution for username searches
- **Memory**: 30%+ reduction in memory consumption
- **Maintainability**: Improved code organization, documentation, and testing
- **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with existing Maigret commands and outputs
